# Patent Search Application

# Live Application located at [patentsearch.vercel.app](patentsearch.vercel.app)

## Inspiration

Having had experience researching and looking into patents. I have realized that it would be nice to create a basic searching funtion which would allow users to search with patent numbers and reel/frame numbers to pull up assignments as well as PAIR data at the exact same time and the exact same place. This is very useful for Lawyers at corporations who want to verify the assignment history as well as the PAIR history in order to determine if the paperwork is in order before a sale.

## Main Things Learned

- Created two custom hooks to deal with API calls to the USPTO Patent Assignment and PAIR databases.
- More practice with dynamic data output and displaying it with semantic UI.
- Bypassing CORS issue with front end HTTP requests by hosting a Flask backend which would be the API that would be utilized with the PAIR database structure. Allowing my Frontend to then use that API as a reliable source of data.

## Design Utilization

Due to the ease of use of the hooks sytem, decided to implement the system with just functional based components and using useState and useEffect for the different behaviors needed when components need to be re-rendered.

## UI

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
